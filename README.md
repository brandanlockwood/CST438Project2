## PROJECT 2 part 2
1. **What is the theme youâ€™ll be using for project 2?**

 - Rock

2. **How did you incorporate your theme using APIs, your bot, and styling, within your project?**

 - Using the SeatGeek API users will find local concerts and the bot has new command called rock on to allow it to rock.The text font,color, and background image all have harsh style to them.

3. **What are known problems, if any, with your project?**

 - Current problem sometimes the login buttons won't work. Which as short fix just refresh the webpage. It will show multiple logins due to the login being successful, but creating error. If the url is over 1000 characters it will also crash the app due to database constraint.

4. **How would you improve it if you had more time?**

 - I would have a log out button for the user. Try to fix the issue of having the user able to sign in multiple times allowing multiples instances of those users.
